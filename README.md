## Intersection of HUNDREDS rectangles, no API\!

### Description

Curious of how to get the intersection of hundreds rectangles almost instantly

and with no API? Then come and see!...

Arabian and italian algorithms in play!

----

This little demo shows live intersection of 2 up to hundreds rectangles.

It produces: A) a boolean indicating whether all rectangles intersect

B) the intersection rectangle itself

The homemade method for finding the intersection rectangle (in 'IntersectHomeMade' function)

is mine and consists of defining all (2*number of rectangles)^2 intersection points (both real

and virtual) and then filtering them to find the only 4 points belonging to all rectangles.

A very unusual way, isn't?

In the same routine, the method for finding whether or not the 2 rectangles intersect (boolean

value) is not fully mine but derived by a recent post on the planet: 'Knowing whether two

objects intersect' (by Tarek Said, level Intermediate, Coding Standards, submitted august 12 2K1).

I hope yow like the effort, have fun :)
